      <h5>The Thoughts That Keep Me Up At Night, <span class="w3-opacity">September 28, 2023</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>I was raised in a family of 10. At a point I was sent home from my school because no money for school fees. I hawk murchiya (pardon me I don't know the name in English),</p>

<p> After my secondary I moved to Abuja to hustle. At a point I got a job in a business center where I was to be paid N4k a month as salary. But 4 months in the job I wasn't paid a dime as salary. How I survive, only God knows. One time I could no afford money to even eat. So my friend and I will go inside bush to go and pluck unriped guava just to survive for that day. Let me also add that I was sleeping inside in a saloon. I always sleep whenever the owner of the salon finishes for the day. I will spray a clothe on the floor to sleep, no pillow, no nothing inside the shop. </p>

<p> Time past, I gather small money which I used to go write JAMB. On the day of the JAMB, after the exam, I didn't have transport money to come back. I just went there, without even thinking how I am going to come back. So what I did was to beg one man who brought his children with his car. As God will have it, they were going close to where I live. </p>

<p>JAMB result came out I score 191. Hmm what do I say. Live goes on. To my greatest surprise I got admitted into ABU, Zaria with the result. </p>

<p> In the university I didn't have money for accommodation, so I had to squat with other students because I used my savings to pay for the school fees. While in the university, sometimes I go hustle outside campus just to get money to survive. </p>

<p> As time goes one, I was able to secured 2 scholarships which has helped me complete my university and came out with 2.1. </p>

<p> Today I am a graduate, owned a car, and now i am into freelancing - website development and graphics design. </p>

<p> In all these I give God the glory and I am still hoping for better life ahead..</p>

      <h3><b>Here Are My Thoughts</b></h3>
      <h5>Poverty And School Drop Out Amongst Litlle children, <span class="w3-opacity">April 2, 2014</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Welcome to the lives of Nigeria’s street kids! They seem uncovered by the Nigerian constitution which clearly spells out in Section 34, sub-section 1c that “no person shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.” Many of them, indeed, are “forced” to perform “compulsory labour.” </p>


<p> There is a class of children who neither feel good nor happy. Their outlook paints a vivid picture of their state of helplessness.</p>

<p> They appear unkempt and totally hopeless regarding their future. In their tattered clothes, they find homes in the most filthy and awkward places like abandoned buildings, under overhead bridges and school premises. Usually, they retire to these “abodes” at dusk and dash out early in the morning before the prying eyes of security agents or the rightful owners of the structures turn out for business.</p>

<p> Holding a bottle of water mixed with little soap, another detergent in one hand and an improvised brush  in the other, he walks up to a car in traffic uninvited, and begins to wash its windscreen, hoping the car owner or driver would be compassionate enough to give him some money.</p>

<p> At the other end of the road, a teenage girl of school age hawks oranges when she should ordinarily be in the classroom.</p>
<p>Yet, there are others whose only source of livelihood  is begging for alms. These ones approach you with words that will soften any heart. In that brief encounter of  less than one minute, they will tell you the grief  they have been passing through.</p>
